A recent project I was working on is an online e-commerce shop providing
different kind of merchandise. From T-shirts and hoodies to different electronics.
They range from different audio equipment to USB accesories and much more. 
The part I am the most fond of is a design that is fairly clear and easy to use by customers. 

I used [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) to create the e-shop and for customisation of design I used [Minimog](https://minimog.co). 

If you want to check it out you can see it on: [Unworldlyunicorn site](https://unworldlyunicorn.com). However I'm not sure how long I will keep it running since it was mostly a learning experience. 

### Overview of several sections:

Bellow you can see couple of parts of the website. 
Each article has a lovely colorful variations in design which contribute to easier selection of products.
