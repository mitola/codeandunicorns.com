![Asteroid](posts/asteroid.jpg "")
Rotating slowly around axis of its own miniscule gravity,  
Small asteroid of mostly metallic mixture of elements,  
Just rotating round the giant planet made of gas,  
Radiating its interiors inside out.  

On surface miniature,  
molten lakes,  
small hills and crevices,  
Hosting life based on silicates and metals,  
Evolution boosted by radiated rays.  

Through years gone by,  
Sun ray absorbing crystals forming,  
With small domes and crops forming all around.  

What does the future hold,  
For this is only start of a new era.
