For thee, dear Petri dish,  
Which supplies us knowledge,  
with culturing what we can not see,  
Thanks for the insights that enlighten us .  

Let us fill thee with agar,  
And as a chef fills his favourite dish,  
Enrich you!  

A bit salts, carbs,amino acids and blood,  
For mix to fully flourish,  
Adding a bit of dye,  
To make it easier to see.  

After the mix carefully prepared,  
We wait until the culture matures.
