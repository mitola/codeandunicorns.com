Following is an example of simplest possible setup of dashboard add-on for kops. By default we utilize the official yaml configuration which already works fabulously with basic user-authentication. That should be perfect for a very small or one person team. Generally though, it is very smart to double check security of the monitoring service itself and extend upon it.

  1. First run the yaml configuration of kops dashboard add-on:  
    `kubectl create -f <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kops/master/addons/kubernetes-dashboard/v1.8.3.yaml">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kops/master/addons/kubernetes-dashboard/v1.8.3.yaml</a>`
  2. Go to URL that got created:To get the URL:`
kubectl cluster-info | grep master
`  
    Example URL:`
https://api-yoururl.amazonaws.com/ui`
  3. To get the login token that you will be asked on the URL:  
    `kubectl get secret $(kubectl get serviceaccount dashboard -o jsonpath="{.secrets[0].name}") -o jsonpath="{.data.token}" | base64 --decode`
  4. Default login credentials you can get by using following kops command in terminal:  
    Username: admin  
    Password: (using command)`kops get secrets kube --type secret -oplaintext`
  5. But for now majority of the panels will be not viewable or available for edit etc. To fix this we will create a service account with access to default namespace and do a clusterrolebinding. However for future, it is good to have as much things as possible on NOT default namespace.  


  #To create a service account with access to default namespace
  `kubectl create serviceaccount dashboard -n default`
 
 
#To create a cluster role bind. Connecting service account and cluster level access
`kubectl create clusterrolebinding dashboard-admin -n default \
--clusterrole=cluster-admin \
--serviceaccount=default:dashboard`
