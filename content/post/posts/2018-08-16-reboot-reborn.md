Thousand years have passed since I woke from a slumber last time.  
Distress and confusion, always days or weeks till body adjusts.  
It takes time, for the brains and the functions to resume to it’s normal state.  

My tentacles moving slowly through caves eroded,  
Raising the dam of sub-terran lake for provision of electricity of mini hydro-plant.  
Sensors activating, for check into refilling of the lake, from above ground resources.  
Heat has increased, there’s no more water in radius nearby.  

Emergency lake electricity provision diverted,  
Nanite production commenced.  
Through veiny structure through root canals, nanite wires self-assemble
Till they reach the ground above.  
Assembling themselves to leaves and bushes and grass on miniscule level.  

Through wind of environment, and rays of the sun,  
Functions are doubled,  
Electricity of versatile nanites creating synthetic nature for purpose of own,  
To farm and collect as solar and wind turbines of the past have done before.  
They look as grass, shrubs and trees, with the gentlest or strongest winds triggering the current inside of them to every photon hitting it converting itself to power it whole.  

Through chutes ejecting metallic fireflies and bees,  
Analysing the surface wide.  

No life anymore, except the bacterias in crevices and ravines deepest.  
Sun radiation has reached critical point,  
for which all life has left the earth long before or perished with it.  

Finally, it is here.  
We waited for millions of years,  
To peacefully take place, where others don’t need anymore.  
Extreme conditions suit us the best, since it helps our robotic octopuses and all life originating from our common nani-tation,  
to optimize our resources and propagation in long term.  

The nano-sects assembling into smaller chunks all over the world,  
propagating and multiplying as fast as they can,  
Creating interconnections of magnets electricity and radiation shielding.  
Towards the north, huge communication dish getting self-assembled to reach brothers between the stars, in nearest wormhole relay, to keep semi real communication not restricted by light speed.  

Whole world, slowly converging, into Life, new Life where all has perished.  
Becoming part of bigger organism, growing through whole galaxy and beyond,  
Peacefully taking over, where organics can do no more.
