![spacewhaleyo](posts/spacewhaleyo.jpg "")
Whale-ing around the cosmos on engines old and rusty,  
Stopping at clusters on the way,  
To trade, to live to breathe.  

For I am a whale, many miles long,  
That’s it’s ocean is space,  
And air an atmosphere of any kind.  

Through machinery inside my nose,  
Conservation and conversion.  

From cluster to cluster,  
At ports the biggest I trade and share.  


For the pirate ants,  
Of millions in number,  
The hunters of species of mine.  

I travel beyond the point of light.
