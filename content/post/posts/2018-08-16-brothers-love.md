![Mars the fourth](posts/marsthefourth.jpg "")

Throughout the eons of yesterday’s, I have watched you.  
Watched your fiery soul develop, melt and burn.  
Reshaping through time forever more, forming bumps and cracks till flat ain’t no more.  
Your valleys deep condense with water, your tops moisten into clouds and drops,   marking the landscape in blue and white.  

Through eons passed you evolved into being a new,  
forming habitats uncounted and life in variations infinite.  
You, Earth the most beautiful of sibling ours,  
Helios of light the bringer of everything till doom arrives.  

May your future be green with orbital trees,  
May your life become one with you.  

I can’t heat no more, we rotated as one in dawn of our youth,  
But now I am old, dancing slower and always catching your steps, your seasons, you all,  
I can take no more.  

May Helios be bright forevermore.  


Yours truly,  
Mars the Fourth
