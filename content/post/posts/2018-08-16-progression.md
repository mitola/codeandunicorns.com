When you look at yourself,  
In this modern day and age.  
Do you ever stop,  
To think to yourself?  

Do you ever stop,  
And see difference from the past?  

Merit knowledge we posses,  
Has exponentially evolved.  

There no point,  
To be petrified by yourself,  
Emotions that are in the loop,  
for the last million or so years.  

Embrace the newness,  
That the current future is.  

The possibilities it opens,  
And gifts of knowledge and tranquility it brings.  

Rejoice!  
Letâ€™s rejoice ourselves,  
With embrace of wisdom.
