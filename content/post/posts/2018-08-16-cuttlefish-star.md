Cuddle cuddle that tiny cuttlefish.

Through telescopes immersive,  
All eyes are glued to the asteroid going round n’ round the moon.  

On that tiny rock liquid water shines,  
And it’s borders with glassy crystals and metallic rock,  
Make a real treat for eyes to see.  

In months two ago,  
Cousins that divorced long ago have returned,  
Returned to home where they once were one.  

For what is gathered through communication,  
between humanity and the cuttlefish,  
Several million years a subspecies of cuttle’s,  
evolved above average intelligence,  
Creating temporary structures, habitats,  
even writing in the water with the sophisticated usage of their ink sacs.  

Due to their evolution,  
They are predisposed to be one with the nature,  
And have it expand in it’s own pristine environment.  

After they achieved sufficient stage to ascend into the coldness of space,  
They stayed on smaller rocks orbiting the earth,  
Regularly supplying them,  
Combining them one by one into enormous structure.  

In the structure, they were recreating their home environment,  
With sufficient growth of algae sponges and the whole ecosystem of the sea,  
Adding all the prey they eat, so only they were sustained as top predators.  

Due to their faster evolutionary cycle and shorter life span,  
They were able to achieve incredible regulated celapholution.  
Increased their lifespan, their adaptability to zero gravity,  
Their ink sacs expanding to support their desire for written word.  

Now, many years after departing, a part of them returned.  
They mostly reside in many asteroids and comets around the solar system,  
And far far beyond the stars we could only dream of visiting before.  

After months have passed,  
And communication advanced,  
With complex almost alien like differences were crossed,  
The reality finally dawned upon us fully.  

Threat, far beyond their ability to deal with, started to cross through the galaxy,  
Ravaging species and habitats,  
Sentient or not away.  

They have come to bring the word of warning,  
And invitation to join the world’s retaliating the threat everywhere.  
Luckily due to physics warning is early,  
But will it be early enough?
