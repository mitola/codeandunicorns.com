## **[Aircrack-ng](http://www.aircrack-ng.org/)**

Aircrack is quite a useful tool. It focuses on several aspects of wifi connected security and breaking into Wifi for certain encryptions as well.

> For monitoring Aircrack provides: Capturing of packets and export of that data to text files for further processing.
> 
> For Cracking: It can focus on relatively straightforward cracking of WEP and WPA PSK (WPA 1 & 2)
> 
> For Testing: Checking of WiFi cards and driver capabilities for capturing data and injection of data.
> 
> For Attacks for testing: Replay attack, de-authentication, fake access points, and other attacks done via packet injections.

## **[Fern Wifi Cracker](https://github.com/savio-code/fern-wifi-cracker)**

It&#8217;d like to add this one as part of the same set of duo tools. In comparison to some other tools, this one provides quite a bit functionality through its GUI interface, which makes it a lot more convenient.

Since a lot of features are quite similar  to aircrack&#8217;s I&#8217;m attaching a quote from Fern Github page to emphasize similarities and differences in features of the tool:

> 1. WEP Cracking with Fragmentation,Chop-Chop, Caffe-Latte, Hirte, ARP Request Replay or WPS attack
> 
> 2. WPA/WPA2 Cracking with Dictionary or WPS based attacks
> 
> 3. Automatic saving of key in database on successful crack
> 
> 4. Automatic Access Point Attack System
> 
> 5. Session Hijacking (Passive and Ethernet Modes)
> 
> 6. Access Point MAC Address Geo Location Tracking
> 
> 7. Internal MITM Engine
> 
> 8. Bruteforce Attacks (HTTP,HTTPS,TELNET,FTP)

## **[Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/)**

I think no coverage of tools in pentesting can be complete without at least mentioning Metasploit framework.  
The extensive suite contains a huge amount of exploits and modules for analysing monitoring , creating payloads, etc.

Therefore better then listing some features it would be to explore their exploit database.

You can explore it [HERE](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/) on rapid7 website.

## **[Armitage](http://www.fastandeasyhacking.com/)**

This is a tool that is quite a bit connected to Metasploit framework as well. It&#8217;s making it easier to use Metasploit framework, with visualisations of targets, recommendation of exploits and and exposure of advanced post-exploitation tools,snippets of the framework. For easier usage and depending on where you use it, I seriously suggest at least skipping through their [manual](http://www.fastandeasyhacking.com/manual). In short, hacking with &#8216;sploits, made easier.

## **[Nmap](https://nmap.org/)**

Another network tool, even though this one isn&#8217;t meant for a direct effect like Fern tool, or Metasploit framework, but it is a very necessary tools for pentesters and ethical hackers a like. It aids in defining and understanding your target network, to uncover the host behind, services, OS that&#8217;s running on, what firewalls are enabled and filters. All of that is basically done with analysis of raws IP packets, and making a more logical output out of that to help you in determining attack vectors.
